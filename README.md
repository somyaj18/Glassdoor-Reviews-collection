# 🚀 Selenium Glassdoor Reviews Scraper

This project uses **Selenium with undetected ChromeDriver** to scrape company reviews from [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/).  
It currently navigates to the **Oracle reviews page**, waits for the JavaScript content to fully load, and prints the page title.  
This is a base that you can expand to collect detailed reviews, ratings, and more.
